# Convert a brainfuck program to Sceql.

# Written by Graue in 2012. Public domain. No warranty.

# Brainfuck dialect is 8-bit wrapping, input 0 on EOF,
# newline behavior not specified (depends on Sceql implementation).
# Tape is unbounded to the right but going left past the initial cell causes
# undefined behavior.

# This works by converting first to the intermediate language 'sceqlfuck',
# created by Keymaker in the process of proving Sceql's Turing-completeness.
# Thanks to Keymaker for that language (and the translations from sceqlfuck
# into Sceql).

# To convert brainfuck to sceqlfuck:
# Treating the two stacks as an array is easy, but whenever we move to the
# right we have to explicitly ask for more space as needed.
# So we model the tape as:
#  [c1 1 c2 1 c3 1 c4 ... 1] [ci ... 1 cn 0]
#                             ^^
# where cX is the value at cell X, cell i is active, n cells have been
# allocated, and each 1 value signals that there is another allocated cell
# to the right.
# The first [] is stack two with topmost value on the right.
# The second [] is stack one with topmost value on the left, and is always
# active when evaluating a bf command.

# So, to initialize, we want things looking like
#  [] [c1 0]
#      ^^    where c1 = 0.
# This is simple, just push two zero values onto stack one.
