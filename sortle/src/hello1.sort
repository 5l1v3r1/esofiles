# This will delete itself when run
world := ""

# This will run first and rename itself to "hello, world"
hello := "hello, " ".!" "" ? ~          # grabs "world" using a regex

# First hello runs, then world. world deletes itself, and hello remains.
# Since hello has renamed itself to "hello, world", that is what's displayed.
