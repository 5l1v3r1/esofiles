The Qdeql Programming Language

Qdeql is a minimalistic programming language with just one queue for
data storage and nothing else. The commands are

  = NEXT   Dequeue a byte and enqueue it again
  - DEC    Dequeue a byte, subtract one (wrapping around), and enqueue it
  \ BEGIN  Dequeue a byte and skip to the instruction after the
           corresponding END if the byte is zero; otherwise, enqueue the
           byte again, followed by two zero bytes
  / END    Go back to the corresponding BEGIN
  & INPUT  Read a byte from stdin and enqueue it (0 for EOF)
  * OUTPUT Dequeue a byte and write it to stdout

As you may have guessed, the queue is a queue of bytes. They're treated 
as integers from 0 to 255.

Dequeueing an empty queue produces zero.
