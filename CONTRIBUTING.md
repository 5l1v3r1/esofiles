# Contributing

## Desired/awesome

* Programs written in esolangs.
* Short and sweet, one-file interpreters for esolangs.

## However, I prefer not to add more...

* Zips, .tar.gz files, etc. If your esolang interpreter/compiler is a
  whole project, it's probably better to create your own repo for it
  and link there from the [Esolangs.org
  wiki](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page). I know we have some
  archives here, but the practice dates to a pre-GitHub era, and I
  would like to not add more of these.
